          I&apos;m a young and ambitious developer currently based in Istanbul, Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love creating things that make peoples&apos; lives better, be it because they&apos;re useful or just plain fun.
          For that, I&apos;m always eager to learn new technologies and hone my craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m also good with people and consistently well liked in all teams I&apos;ve worked with.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I hope you&apos;ve enjoyed this so far, and if you have, head on over to the last page to learn more or get in touch with me. :)
